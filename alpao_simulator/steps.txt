Steps:
[V] Define the mirror's and actuators geometry 
[V] Create mirror's mask 
[V] Generate the zonal InfluenceFunction (IFF) cube (using ThinPlateSpline), and from it the
    Interaction Matrix (INTMAT) and its inverse, the Reconstraction Matrix (RECMAT)
- Generate the Zernike cube projected on the mask and normalized in it to 1
